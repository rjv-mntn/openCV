This is a simple project that I have done as my helloWorld project in openCV with C++. All my previous academic CV work was done on MATLAB.

It took me a about 5-6 hours to get this to work as it works now.

The video output is shown here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37_w6K86sXk

This code can be executed by calling the run script as : ./mycv.sh simpleVehicleCounter.cpp 
(having openCV installed is a pre-requiste)
